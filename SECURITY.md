## Reporting a Vulnerability

Submit one vulnerability per report unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to achieve impact. 
Please provide a detailed vulnerability report with step-by-step instructions to reproduce the 
issue. Provide this information into an issue in the repository. I'll stay in close contact with 
you throughout the process of resolution of the issue and generate a new version of the service
with the correction of it.
